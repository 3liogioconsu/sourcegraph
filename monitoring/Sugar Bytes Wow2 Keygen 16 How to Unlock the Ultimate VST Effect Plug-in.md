WOW2 16 has a compact and intuitive GUI that lets you access all the features easily. You can choose from 21 filter types, ranging from classic lowpass, highpass and bandpass filters to more exotic ones like comb, vowel, diode MS and 030. You can also switch between serial and parallel filter routing for more flexibility.
  
The modulation section of WOW2 16 is where the magic happens. You can modulate any parameter with one of the four sources: an envelope follower with frequency detection, an LFO with 13 waveforms, a 16-step step sequencer and the Wobble knob. The Wobble knob is a unique feature that changes the shape and speed of the LFO with one twist. You can also modulate the modulators themselves for more complex results.
  
The distortion unit of WOW2 16 adds some grit and character to your sound. You can choose from seven algorithms, including tube-inspired parabolic, bit crusher, sine and diabolic. You can also place the distortion before or after the filter section for different effects.

## How to Use WOW2 16?
  
To use WOW2 16, you need to load it as a plugin on your DAW or as a standalone application on your computer or mobile device. Then, you need to route an audio signal to its input. You can use any sound source, such as a synth, a guitar, a drum loop or a vocal track.
  
Once you have an audio signal going through WOW2 16, you can start tweaking the parameters to create your desired filter effect. Here are some tips to help you get started:
  
- Use the filter type menu to select a filter type that suits your sound source and style. For example, if you want to create a warm and juicy lowpass filter effect on a bass sound, you can try the steep 8-pole LP filter.
- Use the cutoff knob to adjust the frequency range of the filter. You can also use the resonance knob to boost or cut the frequencies around the cutoff point.
- Use the mix knob to blend the dry and wet signals. You can also use the volume knob to adjust the output level of WOW2 16.
- Use the modulation section to add some movement and variation to your filter effect. You can assign any parameter to any modulation source by dragging and dropping or right-clicking on it. You can also adjust the intensity (bi-polar) of each modulation source by using the circular elements at the bottom of the modulation section.
- Use the distortion unit to add some harmonic distortion to your sound. You can select an algorithm from the menu and adjust its drive amount with the knob. You can also switch between pre- and post-filter modes by clicking on the button.
- Use the vowel mode to create vocal-like effects on your sound. You can select two vowels from the menu and adjust their balance with the knob. You can also switch between serial and parallel modes by clicking on the button.
